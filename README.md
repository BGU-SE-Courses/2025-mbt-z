### Troubleshooting

* If you get an error that the chromedriver version is not compatible for your chrome version, lookup your chrome version in [this json](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/known-good-versions-with-downloads.json) and replace the chromedriver located in `Selenium/chromedriver.exe` with the appropriate chrome driver for your system.

## What we tested
We tested the forum module that allows for creating forums and publishing discussions. We chose to test the following user stories: 

*User story:* A student comments on a forum.

*Preconditions:* There is a course with a teacher, and the forum exists.

*Expected outcome:* The comment is added to the forum.

*User story:* The teacher deletes the forum.

*Preconditions:* There is a course with a teacher, and the forum exists.

*Expected outcome:* The forum is deleted successfully.

## How we tested
We used two different testing methods:
1. [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/), a behavior-driven testing framework.
2. [Provengo](https://provengo.tech/), a story-based testing framework.

Each of the testing methods is elaborated in its own directory.
